# The History of Brat

## The Earliest Records

The origin of *brat* remains uncertain. Nineteenth-century etymologists such as Wedgwood, E. Müller, and Skeat proposed that the word may once have referred to <span style="color:#8B5CF6">a coarse garment or rag</span>. Editors of the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com), however, note that no historical evidence confirms a semantic connection between "cloth" and the earliest attested sense meaning <span style="color:#60A5FA">"child."</span>[^1]

The oldest known record of the "cloth" sense appears in Old English, where *bratt* referred to <span style="color:#F97316">an outer garment, often rough or makeshift</span>. An example from the [*Lindisfarne Gospels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels) illustrates this early use:[^2] At this stage, *bratt* simply denoted a garment and carried no association with children or behavior.

> **Translation:** To the one who wants to take your tunic, allow also a garment, or a cloak, or a rough outer garment.

## The Emergence of the "Child" Sense

The meaning "child" appeared much later. The earliest known instance dates to 1557:[^3]

> **Yong brats, a trouble: none at all, a maym it seems to bee.**
>
> **Translation:** Young children are no trouble at all; rather, they seem to be a burden or injury.
>
> **Source:** *Tottel's miscellany (Songes and sonettes, written by the ryght honorable Lorde Henry Haward late Earle of Surrey, and other)* | 1557

In this context, *brat* referred to <span style="color:#60A5FA">a child, typically one seen as troublesome</span>. Although sixteenth- and seventeenth-century examples sometimes lack strong contempt, the word frequently implied insignificance. Expressions such as <span style="color:#8B5CF6">*beggar's brat*</span> were common and helped establish a derogatory tone that eventually became dominant in modern English. Over time, *brat* settled into its familiar negative meaning: <span style="color:#F97316">a badly behaved or spoiled child</span>. It shifted from a descriptive term to an evaluative one, used primarily to express disapproval of behaviors rather than simply to indicate age, as in this example:[^4]

> **Repulsed in her appeal for mercy like a beggar's brat.**
>
> **Source:** W. H. Dixon, *Royal Windsor* vol. II. vi. 65 | 1879

Meanwhile a figurative extension also developed. By the late seventeenth century, *brat* could signify <span style="color:#F97316">an offspring or product</span>, as in Ralph Cudworth's 1678 phrase "An Ignoble and Bastardly Brat of Fear".[^5] This metaphorical use widened the word's semantic range while keeping its negative undertones.

## Later Extensions and Socially Specialized Uses

As the "child" meaning became more widespread, *brat* underwent new extensions linked to social identity. A notable development was the use of compounds such as *army brat* or *Hollywood brat*, which referred to <span style="color:#60A5FA">children raised within particular professional cultures</span>. In these cases, the meaning did not necessarily imply misbehavior but instead highlighted shared experiences shaped by mobility, hierarchy, or industry norms.

The word also took on several minor or specialized senses, including:

- names for certain fish species (e.g., turbot or *bret*),[^6]
- a thin layer of pyritic or calcareous material in mining,[^7]
- a U.S. abbreviation for *bratwurst*.[^8]

These uses did not influence the main semantic pathway of *brat*, but they show the term's adaptability in technical and regional contexts.

## A Pop-Culture Catalyst: Charli XCX's *Brat* (2024)

In the early 2020s, *brat* entered a new phase of semantic change shaped by digital culture. The decisive turning point occurred in June, 2024, with the release of [*Brat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_(album)), an album by the British pop singer and songwriter, [Charli XCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX). The cover of the album featured the word *brat* written in a deliberately low-resolution font on a flat, lime-green background—an aesthetic that was simple, direct, and highly reproducible.

Commercially, *Brat* achieved significant success. The album reached number one in the UK, Australia, Croatia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and entered the top ten in fourteen other countries, including the United States. It was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 Album of the Year and nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning three of them.[^9]

## From Pop Culture to Public Communication

Almost immediately after the album's release, online audiences adopted *brat* as a label for a broader cultural mood. Charli XCX explicitly framed *brat* as a concept rather than merely a title. Speaking on a BBC interview, she described *brat* as representing a person who might have "a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra."[^10] The aesthetic became known as "<span style="color:#84CC16">Brat Summer</span>," a trend that spread rapidly across platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, with tens of thousands of posts under hashtags like #bratsummer.

The influence of *brat* quickly expanded beyond music and fashion into public and political discourse. A particularly visible moment occurred during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, when Charli XCX posted the phrase "Kamala IS Brat" on social media. Shortly afterward, Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign team embraced the *brat* aesthetic in its online communication, incorporating the distinctive green color scheme and referencing the album in campaign posts.[^11]

This adoption marked a significant shift in how political messaging engaged with popular language and digital culture. By aligning with *brat*, the campaign signaled cultural awareness and proximity to younger, online audiences.

At the same time, *brat* gained visibility across media, fashion, and lifestyle discourse. The color associated with the album—often referred to as "<span style="color:#84CC16">brat green</span>"—became a recognized trend in the fashion industry, with luxury and designer brands releasing items in similar shades. Social media users widely circulated compound expressions such as *brat green*, *brat girl*, *brat summer*, and *bratosphere*. Media commentary often positioned the *brat girl* in contrast to the earlier *clean girl* ideal, framing *brat* as a challenge to norms of restraint, refinement, and controlled self-presentation.[^12]

## The Meaning of *Brat* in Contemporary Culture

By late 2024, *brat* had acquired a meaning that differs sharply from its historical derogatory sense. Instead of referring to unruly children, the word came to describe <span style="color:#60A5FA">an attitude toward life characterized by emotional openness, informality, and acceptance of imperfection</span>. In an Instagram post on 8 June 2024, Charli XCX described the *brat* ethos as "me, my flaws, my f--- ups, my ego all rolled into one,"[^13] a formulation that was widely quoted and echoed online.

*Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2024*

*Brat* became associated with <span style="color:#F97316">being honest about feelings, not over-polishing one's appearance or behaviors, and allowing for disorder or inconsistency in everyday life</span>. Its accessibility and emotional clarity contributed to its rapid diffusion, leading to its selection by [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com) as **Word of the Year 2024**.[^14]
