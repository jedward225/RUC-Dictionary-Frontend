# The History of Brat

## The Earliest Records

The origin of <span class="term">brat</span> remains uncertain. Nineteenth-century etymologists such as Wedgwood, E. Müller, and Skeat proposed that the word may once have referred to <span class="hl">a coarse garment or rag</span>. Editors of the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com), however, note that no historical evidence confirms a semantic connection between "cloth" and the earliest attested sense meaning <span class="hl-blue">"child."</span><sup>[1]</sup>

The oldest known record of the "cloth" sense appears in Old English, where <span class="term">bratt</span> referred to <span class="hl">an outer garment, often rough or makeshift</span>. An example from the [*Lindisfarne Gospels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels) illustrates this early use:<sup>[2]</sup> At this stage, <span class="term">bratt</span> simply denoted a garment and carried no association with children or behavior.

## The Emergence of the "Child" Sense

The meaning "child" appeared much later. The earliest known instance dates to 1557:<sup>[3]</sup>

> **Yong brats, a trouble: none at all, a maym it seems to bee.**
>
> Translation: Young children are no trouble at all; rather, they seem to be a burden or injury.
>
> **Source:** *Tottel's miscellany (Songes and sonettes, written by the ryght honorable Lorde Henry Haward late Earle of Surrey, and other)* | 1557

In this context, <span class="term">brat</span> referred to <span class="hl-blue">a child, typically one seen as troublesome</span>. Although sixteenth- and seventeenth-century examples sometimes lack strong contempt, the word frequently implied insignificance. Expressions such as <span class="term">beggar's brat</span> were common and helped establish a derogatory tone that eventually became dominant in modern English. Over time, <span class="term">brat</span> settled into its familiar negative meaning: <span class="hl">a badly behaved or spoiled child</span>. It shifted from a descriptive term to an evaluative one, used primarily to express disapproval of behaviors rather than simply to indicate age, as in this example:<sup>[4]</sup>

> **Repulsed in her appeal for mercy like a beggar's brat.**
>
> **Source:** W. H. Dixon, *Royal Windsor* vol. II. vi. 65 | 1879

Meanwhile a figurative extension also developed. By the late seventeenth century, <span class="term">brat</span> could signify <span class="hl">an offspring or product</span>, as in Ralph Cudworth's 1678 phrase "<span class="term">An Ignoble and Bastardly Brat of Fear</span>".<sup>[5]</sup> This metaphorical use widened the word's semantic range while keeping its negative undertones.

## Later Extensions and Socially Specialized Uses

As the "child" meaning became more widespread, <span class="term">brat</span> underwent new extensions linked to social identity. A notable development was the use of compounds such as <span class="term">army brat</span> or <span class="term">Hollywood brat</span>, which referred to <span class="hl-blue">children raised within particular professional cultures</span>. In these cases, the meaning did not necessarily imply misbehavior but instead highlighted shared experiences shaped by mobility, hierarchy, or industry norms.

The word also took on several minor or specialized senses, including:

- names for certain fish species (e.g., turbot or <span class="term">bret</span>),<sup>[6]</sup>
- a thin layer of pyritic or calcareous material in mining,<sup>[7]</sup>
- a U.S. abbreviation for <span class="term">bratwurst</span>.<sup>[8]</sup>

These uses did not influence the main semantic pathway of <span class="term">brat</span>, but they show the term's adaptability in technical and regional contexts.

## A Pop-Culture Catalyst: Charli XCX's *Brat* (2024)

In the early 2020s, <span class="term">brat</span> entered a new phase of semantic change shaped by digital culture. The decisive turning point occurred in June, 2024, with the release of [*Brat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_(album)), an album by the British pop singer and songwriter, [Charli XCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX). The cover of the album featured the word <span class="term">brat</span> written in a deliberately low-resolution font on a flat, lime-green background—an aesthetic that was simple, direct, and highly reproducible.

Commercially, *Brat* achieved significant success. The album reached number one in the UK, Australia, Croatia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and entered the top ten in fourteen other countries, including the United States. It was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 Album of the Year and nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning three of them.<sup>[9]</sup>

## From Pop Culture to Public Communication

Almost immediately after the album's release, online audiences adopted <span class="term">brat</span> as a label for a broader cultural mood. Charli XCX explicitly framed <span class="term">brat</span> as a concept rather than merely a title. Speaking on a BBC interview, she described <span class="term">brat</span> as representing a person who might have "a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra."<sup>[10]</sup> The aesthetic became known as "<span class="hl-green">Brat Summer</span>," a trend that spread rapidly across platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, with tens of thousands of posts under hashtags like #bratsummer.

The influence of <span class="term">brat</span> quickly expanded beyond music and fashion into public and political discourse. A particularly visible moment occurred during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, when Charli XCX posted the phrase "Kamala IS Brat" on social media. Shortly afterward, Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign team embraced the <span class="term">brat</span> aesthetic in its online communication, incorporating the distinctive green color scheme and referencing the album in campaign posts.<sup>[11]</sup>

This adoption marked a significant shift in how political messaging engaged with popular language and digital culture. By aligning with <span class="term">brat</span>, the campaign signaled cultural awareness and proximity to younger, online audiences.

At the same time, <span class="term">brat</span> gained visibility across media, fashion, and lifestyle discourse. The color associated with the album—often referred to as "<span class="hl-green">brat green</span>"—became a recognized trend in the fashion industry, with luxury and designer brands releasing items in similar shades. Social media users widely circulated compound expressions such as <span class="hl-green">brat green</span>, <span class="hl-green">brat girl</span>, <span class="hl-green">brat summer</span>, and <span class="term">bratosphere</span>. Media commentary often positioned the <span class="term">brat girl</span> in contrast to the earlier <span class="term">clean girl</span> ideal, framing <span class="term">brat</span> as a challenge to norms of restraint, refinement, and controlled self-presentation.<sup>[12]</sup>

## The Meaning of *Brat* in Contemporary Culture

By late 2024, <span class="term">brat</span> had acquired a meaning that differs sharply from its historical derogatory sense. Instead of referring to unruly children, the word came to describe <span class="hl-blue">an attitude toward life characterized by emotional openness, informality, and acceptance of imperfection</span>. In an Instagram post on 8 June 2024, Charli XCX described the <span class="term">brat</span> ethos as "me, my flaws, my f--- ups, my ego all rolled into one,"<sup>[13]</sup> a formulation that was widely quoted and echoed online.

<span class="term">Brat</span> became associated with <span class="hl">being honest about feelings, not over-polishing one's appearance or behaviors, and allowing for disorder or inconsistency in everyday life</span>.
